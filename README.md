   <h1>VRCLauncher - Final</h1>
   <p>READ!!! Since this program is made by me a nobody, in visual studio some trash antivirus software will falsely flag it as virus without actually checking if it is a virus. It's 100% clean, you can look at the code in DnSpy nothing malicious in there.</p>
   <p><a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/e0b5db95c2e2e1f8636fe44e85167d040f710ca0d10679d8120218ff7024e2c4">Virus Total Results</a> as you see only 4 antivirus actually flag it falsely and all 4 of them are some no name bum ass antivirus software.</p>
   <p>Launches VRChat with optional arguments and functions.</p>

   Majority of these functions are created to lower the amount of work the user has to do to get the most out of the game.<br /><br />
   Functions like Empty VRC-Chache can fix certain lag spikes, Bullshit Closer can help to gain more FPS with weak CPUs, and more.<br /><br />
   The program has been tested a lot in the last days and performed very well, in case you do encounter a bug let me know.<br /><br />
